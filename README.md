# How to run the application

### 1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

### 2. Create .env or .env.local file in the project root with the following content:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://localhost:8080/ #the backend url
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=
```

#### TO ENABLE reCAPTCHA, SEE BELOW:
Go to this [website](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create) and create a new reCAPTCHA project.
1. Label can be anything.
2. In the type section, select *Challenge (v2)* and then select *"I'm not a robot" Checkbox*.
3. In the domains section: For development, type in localhost (without port). For production, type in the actual domain name.
4. At last, click *Submit* and the next page should show you two keys. Copy and place these keys in their corresponding spots in the .env file.

### 4. Using a NodeJS package manager (e.g., npm) , install dependencies with the command:
```bash
npm install
```


### 5. Run the development server:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

```bash

```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

When importing the project or in the project's settings, add the environment variables found in the .env file.
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = #URL of the back-end deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY = 
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY = 
```
To enable RECAPTCHA in Vercel, create a new RECAPTCHA project or edit settings of the current one. In the settings, add the URL of the Vercel project deployment as a domain.
Then copy the site key and secret key and place them in the Vercel project's environment variables.
